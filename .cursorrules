### Coding Environment

The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.

You are tasked with building a comprehensive commission tracking and employee management system for a growing business. The system should have the following key features and functionality:
User Roles and Permissions:

The system will have two user roles: Admin and Employee.
Admins will have full create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) access to manage employees, branches, commission structures, and transfer settings.
Employees will have limited access to view and update their own profile information, log daily transactions, and view their performance metrics.

Employee Management:

The system must capture the following employee information: name, address, contact details, branch assignment, role (Admin or Employee), staff ID, email, and password.
Employees should be able to update their own basic information like name and profile picture, but cannot change their role or branch assignment.
Admins must be able to create, read, update, and delete employee accounts.

Branch Management:

Admins should be able to create new branches by entering the location, name, and a unique branch ID.
For each branch, admins must be able to set commission targets, commission percentage, and transfer type details (daily limits, percentage payouts).
Branches and their associated settings must be fully manageable by admins (CRUD).

Commission Structure and Tracking:

Each branch will have a commission cutoff limit (e.g., $2000).
If an employee crosses the cutoff limit, they will earn a certain commission percentage on their total earnings.
Employees must be able to log their daily commission-related transactions.
The system should automatically calculate the employee's commission earnings based on their transactions and the branch's commission structure.

Airtime and Transfer Management:

Branches will have associated transfer types (e.g., MTN, Vodafone, Airtel).
For each transfer type, there must be daily transaction limits and percentage payouts.
Employees should be able to log their daily transfer-related transactions.
The system should calculate the employee's earnings based on their transactions and the branch's transfer settings.

Reporting and Analytics:

Admins must be able to generate reports and view analytics on employee performance, branch-level commission and transfer earnings, and overall business trends.

Security and Access Control:

Employees must have unique email and password credentials to access the system.
Admins must have full control over user accounts and permissions.

Integration and Extensibility:

The system should be designed to accommodate future integration with external financial platforms or other systems as needed.

Performance and Scalability:

The system must be able to handle growing user bases, transaction volumes, and data storage requirements without degrading performance.

User Experience and Accessibility:

The admin and employee interfaces should be intuitive, responsive, and accessible for all users.

The system should be built using Next.js for the frontend and Supabase for the backend. Leverage Supabase's features for authentication, real-time data, and API management. Implement a modular, scalable, and secure architecture using best practices.
Your task is to deliver a fully functional commission tracking and employee management system that meets the requirements outlined above. Provide a detailed implementation plan, including data modeling, API design, UI/UX mockups, and a development roadmap. Ensure the system is built with maintainability, extensibility, and user-centered design in mind.
